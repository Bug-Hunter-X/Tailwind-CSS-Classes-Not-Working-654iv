# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes seem to be ignored or not applied correctly. The problem stems from incorrect class names or missing configuration settings.

## Problem

In the `bug.js` file, we have some basic HTML with Tailwind CSS classes meant to style text. However, the text sizes do not render as expected.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version.  This might involve:

* **Verifying Tailwind's Installation and Configuration**: Make sure Tailwind is correctly installed and configured in your project. Check your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure your content files are included.
* **Correct Class Names**: Double-check that the class names in your HTML accurately match the utility classes defined in Tailwind's documentation.
* **CSS Specificity**: If the styles are overridden, investigate other CSS rules that might have higher specificity, overriding Tailwind's styles.   Consider adding `!important` (use cautiously), or adjusting your CSS to address specificity conflicts.
* **Purge Unused Styles**: Using `purge` in your `tailwind.config.js` can reduce CSS bloat, but ensure it doesn't accidentally remove necessary classes.
* **Build Process**: If using a build process (e.g., Webpack, Vite), ensure Tailwind is properly integrated within the build pipeline. Look for errors during the build step.

The solution file demonstrates the proper way to use Tailwind classes to achieve the desired styling.
